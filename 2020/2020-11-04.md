Today I want to make it clear once and for all to me what the `&` stands for in go. Let's see...

I find that things are nicely summarized in [this blog post](https://winterflower.github.io/2017/08/20/the-asterisk-and-the-ampersand/).
Nonetheless, I'll rephrase (or copy and paste) to let it sink in nicely.

```golang
func main(){
	
	helloWorld := "helloworld"
  
	var pointerToHelloWorld *string
  
	pointerToHelloWorld = &helloWorld
  
	fmt.Println("Pointer to helloWorld")  // this will print out that string
  
	fmt.Println(pointerToHelloWorld)  // this will print out the memory address
  
	fmt.Println(*pointerToHelloWorld)  // this in turn will print out the string again
}
```

Don't just take my word for it, see it with you own eyes at this [playground](https://goplay.space/#Y7PN0WCaXOU).
