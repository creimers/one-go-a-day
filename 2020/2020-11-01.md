I've been struggling with converting an array of structs to json today in golang. First and foremost that's because I know nothing about golang. 
Anyway, [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28411394/golang-and-json-with-array-of-struct) go me on the right track. 

The key takeaway for me here was that

> Your struct fields must be exported (field is exported if it begins with a capital letter) or they won't be encoded.

## bad

```golang
type dataPoint struct {
	x float64
	y float64
	z float64
}
```

## good

```golang
type dataPoint struct {
	X float64 `json:"x"`
	Y float64 `json:"y"`
	Z float64 `json:"z"`
}
```
