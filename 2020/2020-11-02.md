Today, I want to (have to!) execute code every so and so many seconds. Once a second let's say. In JavaScript I'd do:

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
    console.log("another second has passed");
}, 1000);
```

And in golang? How should I know, I don't know anything about golang. [Two methods are proposed in this gist](https://gist.github.com/ryanfitz/4191392). Let's see if one of them works for me.

What I'm ultimately trying to achive is send data from a server to a client via websocket in a super easy, possibly wrong, noobie kind of way. Bear with me.

```golang
counter := 0
for range time.Tick(1 * time.Second) {
	dataOfTheSecond := datapoints[totalDatapoints*counter : totalDatapoints*(counter+1)]
	jsonMessage, _ := json.Marshal(dataOfTheSecond)
	if err = conn.WriteJSON(string(jsonMessage)); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
	counter++
}
```
