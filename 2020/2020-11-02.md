Today, I want to (have to!) execute code every so and so many seconds. Once a second let's say. In JavaScript I'd do:

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
    console.log("another second has passed");
}, 1000);
```

And in golang? How should I know, I don't know anything about golang. [Two methods are proposed in this gist](https://gist.github.com/ryanfitz/4191392). Let's see if one of them works for me.
